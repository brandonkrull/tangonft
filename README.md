# Tango NFT

<a href="https://tangonft.com/" target="_blank">Tango NFT</a> is an ephemeral private message board for every NFT community. No set up required, just log-in with Metamask. Once logged in, you'll see the "rooms" you have access to. Every collection has it's own token-gated "room" where you can leave messages, as your NFT, for others to read.

The second version (code not released yet), is a drawing board for every NFT collection. You can see what people are drawing at <a href="https://tangonft.com/draw" target="blank">TangoNFT.com/draw</a>.

Built using HTML, CSS, jquery, php/MySQL (switching over to React), Metamask API, and OpenSea API.

# Why does this project exist?

I was playing around with the Metamask and OpenSea API trying to figure out if I could build some utility for PixelBeasts (my NFT project). I realized it was just as easy to build for every NFT. After the initial feedback from sharing it, and from from how fun this was to build, I've decided I want to open source it to see where this goes - or at the very least inspire new projects.

In the end, I just want to see cool stuff come to life. Rad if I can be part of it.

# Build Status

I'm just releasing this now, in it's raw format after hacking away at it for two nights (~6 hours), for posterity. Don't worry, someone is already working on switching from php to react. We'll go from there. A few other obvious things:

- Escaping characters in messages.
- Message functions (URLs, emojis, etc.)

Maybe?

- Threads/replies
- 1:1 messaging

And yes, I've had people suggest moving messages on-chain to make this fully decentralized and embeddable anywhere. I'm down.

# Contribute

In the meantime, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/YSqMfAnqzX" target="">PixelBeasts discord</a>, where we talk about this project. It's VCs, developers, artists, and collectors - all with an interest in building and experimenting with new tools.

Let's gooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!

# Quick Note

I'm self-taught and this is my first time sharing code publicly. Be kind please :)

# License

I selected "MIT" from the dropdown. That's open source, right?
